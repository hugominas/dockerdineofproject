1. Build Docker `docker build . -t fortarpack` 
2. Run the container with a mapped volume `docker run -it -v $(pwd)/scripts:/source/scripts fortarpack /bin/bash`
3. the DINEOF make file is inside the folder `/source/DINEOF/`

The ARmake.inc file must be edited:
  line PLAT, to the correct architecture -- ours is PLAT = x86_64
  line FFLAGS, for our architecture, FFLAGS = -o
  line MAKE, for Ubuntu, change to:  MAKE = /usr/bin/make
